# Diabetes Prediction using KNN and GridSearchCV

This is a machine learning project for predicting diabetes using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. GridSearchCV was used for hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal number of neighbors (`k`). The project was built for a Kaggle challenge.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

The goal is to classify whether a patient has diabetes based on medical features. The dataset is preprocessed and a KNN classifier is trained and evaluated using accuracy and other metrics.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn

## ðŸ“ˆ Models and Tools Used

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** â€” for classification
- **GridSearchCV** â€” for hyperparameter tuning
  
## ðŸ§ª Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Cross-validation (optional)
- Best parameters from GridSearchCV

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- From Kaggle: [Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/diabetescsv)
